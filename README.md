Get the full stack running in under 60 seconds:

```bash
# Clone and enter the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd fantasy-insights

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start the stack
make up

# Verify everything is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## Services

- **API**: FastAPI service at http://localhost:8000
- **Web**: Next.js frontend at http://localhost:3000  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL at localhost:5432
- **DB Admin**: pgweb at http://localhost:8081
- **Object Storage**: MinIO console at http://localhost:9001

## Data Ingestion (Stage 1)

### Running Ingestion

```bash
# Run daily refresh (current season/week)
make ingest

# Run backfill for historical data
make backfill SEASONS=2023,2024

# Check ingestion status
make status

# View ops dashboard
# Visit http://localhost:3000/ops
```

### Data Pipeline

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw NFL data ingested from nflverse to MinIO/S3 as Parquet
2. **Raw Tables**: Mirrored to PostgreSQL with JSONB storage
3. **Ops Tracking**: File registry and manifest tracking for idempotency
4. **dbt Sources**: Source definitions with freshness monitoring

### Available Datasets

- `players` - Master player index (snapshot daily)
- `rosters` - Team rosters (seasonal)
- `schedules` - Game schedules (seasonal)
- `weekly_player_stats` - Weekly player statistics
- `participation` - Snap counts and participation  
- `injuries` - Injury reports
- `depth_charts` - Team depth charts

### S3 Data Layout

```
s3://bronze/nflverse/
â”œâ”€â”€ players/snapshot_date=2024-08-26/
â”œâ”€â”€ rosters/season=2024/
â”œâ”€â”€ schedules/season=2024/
â”œâ”€â”€ weekly_player_stats/season=2024/week=01/
â”œâ”€â”€ participation/season=2024/week=01/
â”œâ”€â”€ injuries/season=2024/week=01/
â””â”€â”€ depth_charts/season=2024/week=01/
```

## Stage 3: Baseline Projections

### Running Projections

```bash
# Build efficiency priors and scoring weights
make dbt-seed

# Generate weekly and ROS projections  
make projections

# Example query - top PPR WRs this week
# Connect to database and run:
SELECT p.display_name, fp.team, fp.proj_pts, fp.low, fp.high
FROM marts.f_weekly_projection fp
JOIN staging.stg_players p ON fp.player_id = p.player_id  
WHERE fp.season=2024 AND fp.week=10 AND fp.scoring='ppr' AND fp.position='WR'
ORDER BY fp.proj_pts DESC LIMIT 25;
```

### Projection Methodology

**Transparent, rules-based projections (no ML):**

1. **Volume Prediction**: Team volume Ã— player usage shares (4-week rolling avg)
2. **Efficiency with Shrinkage**: Season-to-date rates shrunk to league priors  
3. **Opponent Adjustment**: Defense vs position modifiers (capped Â±30%)
4. **Scoring**: PPR/Half/Standard with configurable weights
5. **Confidence**: Binomial/Poisson variance with normal approximation

**Key Models:**
- `f_weekly_projection` - Weekly projections by player/week/scoring
- `f_ros_projection` - Rest-of-season aggregates  
- Seeds: `efficiency_priors.csv`, `scoring_weights.csv`

**Sample Queries:** See `/dwh/models/PROJECTION_QUERIES.md`

### Projection Components

Each projection includes:
- **Points**: Expected fantasy points with confidence interval (p10/p90)
- **Components**: Targets, receptions, yards, TDs broken down by type
- **Inputs**: Usage shares, opponent DvP adjustments, shrinkage factors
- **Explainers**: Top drivers of projection changes
